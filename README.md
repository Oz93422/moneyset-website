  <h1>Moneyset</h1>
  <p>
    MoneySet is a site I made to help my little cousin (and anyone else really) understand money stuff without it being boring or confusing.
    It talks about things like poverty—why it happens and how to stay out of it—and how to build wealth the smart way.
    There’s also a cool calculator that shows how much money you actually keep after taxes.
    If you're trying to figure out how money works or just want to be smarter with it, this site’s for you.
